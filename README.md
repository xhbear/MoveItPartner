# MoveItPartner

A casual app idea between the author and his friends.
The app will have a built-in workout clock-in clock-out functionality, and a rankings board.

Functionality milestones:
Phase1 -> fully functional timer, and rankings board.
Phase2 -> hook up to firebase and sync app data online.
Phase3 -> enable quick-share feature that would generate a formatted image containing the user's stats for select period.
Phase4 -> notify all online users if any other user is currently in a workout session.
Phase5 -> add in-app instant messaging capability.
